## üîå Socket.io Events

### Client to Server

- `join-chat` - Join a specific chat room
- `leave-chat` - Leave a chat room
- `typing` - Indicate user is typing
- `register-device` - Register a new device
- `remove-device` - Remove a device

### Server to Client

- `new-message` - New message received
- `message-status-update` - Message status changed
- `message-reaction` - Message reaction added/removed
- `message-deleted` - Message was deleted
- `new-chat` - New chat created
- `user-typing` - User is typing in chat
- `new-contact-request` - New contact request received

- `notifications-cleared` - Notifications were cleared
- `contact-requests-viewed` - Contact requests were viewed
- `devices-updated` - Device list was updated
- `messages-delivered` - Messages were delivered

## üí° Message Delivery Logic

Message delivery works in stages:

1. **Sent**: When a message is first sent, its status is set to `SENT`
2. **Delivered**:
   - When the recipient opens the app (through the `app-opened` event)
   - All undelivered messages are automatically marked as `DELIVERED`
   - This happens in the background without any manual action required
3. **Read**:
   - When the recipient opens a specific chat
   - All messages in that chat are marked as `READ`

This follows WhatsApp's behavior where messages are only marked as delivered when the recipient's app is opened.

## üîí Security Considerations

- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Authentication uses JWT with token blacklisting for logout
- Routes are protected with authentication middleware
- Chat access is verified for each request
- Message reactions and deletions have proper access control

## üìã Caching Strategy

The application uses Redis for efficient caching:

- User profiles: Cached for 1 hour
- Chat data: Basic chat info cached for 1 hour
- Messages: Recent messages cached for 1 hour
- Chat lists: User's chat list cached for 1 hour
- Contacts & Requests: Cached with appropriate TTLs
- Notification counts: Cached for 5 minutes
- Search results: Cached for 10 minutes

Cache invalidation happens automatically when the underlying data changes.

## üì± Multi-device Support

The application supports multiple devices per user:

- Each device is registered with a unique device ID
- All devices receive the same real-time updates
- A user is considered online if any of their devices is active
- Last seen timestamp is updated when all devices are offline
- Device list can be managed through the socket connection

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

The application can be configured through environment variables:

- Database connection
- Redis connection
- JWT secret and expiration
- Cloudinary credentials
- File upload limits
- Server port

## üìä Performance Considerations

- Use connection pooling for database access
- Implement pagination for message retrievals
- Cache frequently accessed data with Redis
- Use WebSockets for real-time updates instead of polling
- Implement proper indexes on database tables
- Use transactions for complex operations
